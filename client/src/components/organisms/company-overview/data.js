      title: 'Environmental Responsibility',

      paragraph:
        "One of KLONDIKE's unprecedented environmental achievements was seen in the formulation of our industrial mill and forestry chain lubricant, which has consistently reduced oil consumption by over 25% compared to any other lubricant of its kind. This has resulted in reduction of waste oil, improving equipment operation and hastening efficiencies in equipment processing. Additionally, it has given enhanced protection to equipment and wear parts from unnecessary premature replacement and disposal while substantially reducing lubricant consumption costs.",
