But the calorie content, texture, flavor, macros and limited, nutritious ingredients in combination, make these outstanding bars! I have tried lots of bars.....most of the ones that taste good have over 200 calories. Limited calorie and ingredient ones also have limited or chemical lavor profile or are hard as a rock. These are a great balance of everything without giving up anything. I will continue to stock these bars, and only these bars."
